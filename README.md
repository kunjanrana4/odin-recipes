 # Odin Recipes
 
Odin Recipes project is the first HTML project from the The Odin Project Foundations course.
The project displays a food recipe HTML webpage by utilizing common html tags for hyperlink, lists and images.
I referred to allrecipes.com and wikipedia to get the recipe information.
With this project, I refreshed my HTML knowledge on various tags and attributes. And, I learnt and practiced the concept of version control with the powerful tool git by following best practices with conventional commit messages.
