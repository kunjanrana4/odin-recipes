            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>6 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>

            <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup sour cream, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add refried black beans, corn, and cream cheese; stir well. Season with cumin, salt, and pepper. Simmer until bean mixture is hot, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>

            <li>Place cilantro, green chiles and liquid, salsa, tomato sauce, vegetable broth, lime juice, garlic, and oregano in a food processor; blend until smooth, about 10 pulses. Spread about 1/3 cilantro salsa mixture in prepared baking dish.</li>

            <li>Spread bean mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla and sprinkle with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Roll tortillas around the cheese and bean fill and arrange enchiladas in the prepared baking dish, seam sides down.</li>

            <li>Pour remaining cilantro salsa mixture over enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes. Garnish with avocado, tomatoes, and sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
