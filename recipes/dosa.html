        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground white gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew).</p>

        <p>Dosas can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. Masala Dosa is a roasted dosa served with potato curry. Newer versions include Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa, and pizza dosa.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch baking soda</li>
            <li>1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cups water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cup water and mix until it's lump free, the chunks of flour have dissolved, and the batter has a good consistency, adding more water if needed.</li>

            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a griddle over medium heat. Pour some of the batter onto the griddle, spread the batter in a circular motion, slowly yet steadily. Cook until the edges start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the grill. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil between each batch.</li>
