        <p>Pizza is a delicious italian dish normally consisting of round crust made from wheat dough and topped with tomato, cheese and other ingredients. A good pizza needs a good choice of well cooked crust, cheese and toppings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups water</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Stir in 2 cups of flour and salt; mix well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 15 minutes. Place dough in bowl dusted with flour cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Roll dough out to half of its final size. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes (while you prepare desired pizza toppings). Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stretch out dough over your floured knuckles and spin/toss 2 to 3 times until desired size is achieved. Place dough on a baker's peel sprinkled with cornmeal or a lightly greased pizza pan. Spread with desired toppings and bake on a pizza stone in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
